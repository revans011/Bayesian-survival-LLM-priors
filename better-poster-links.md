Some people like _better posters_, some do not. I think it partly depends on how you present posters. A dynamic presenter will probably find communication easier with a better poster. A key feature of better posters is the QR code that links to the finer details of the study left off the poster. Interested readers can get that informations, disinterest readers are not burdened with it on the poster.
